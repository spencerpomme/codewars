#### My crusade to 1 kyu. 

Alright, alright, I find myself かなり下手 as a programmer than I supposed to be. Although I'm about to graduate from gradudate school, my whiteboard coding interviews are often **as miserable as うんこ**. So it's time to make a difference!

### So here's the plan:

I'll practice **every day** on coding, from simple task to the more sophisticated ones. Originally I thought about the famous (or infamous?🙉) [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), but later I think this is mostly focused on algorithm and the language specific tricks are not paid as much attention. Maybe I will finally come back for it but obviously not at this stage (become more fluent in the language itself).

So, after a quick investigation, I decided to use [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) (another famous coding site) for this purpose.

**Languages:**

C++ and Python🐍

The reason why I choose the above two languages are:

1. They are used together a lot in data science
2. I had most experience with these two and really like to bring familiarity to the next level
3. I will use them in work a lot in the future

**To become an 1kyu is not a piece of cake (at least for me🙄 ). And it could take long to finally get there. So I made an Achievement-Reward list to encourage me keep going:**

### Achievement Reward List from 9kyu to 1kyu:
